# Here we assume that that you forked the repository of exercises into your
# own Github account (or at the very least that you have "pushing rights" to 
# a remote).

# EXERCISE 1. Git Push-Ups.
# #########################

# You are now warmed up. It is time to look back at when you started
# this course. You were a different person, and so this was a different
# folder.

# a. Open the Git Panel:
# - For VSCode users: third icon from the top, on the left. 

# b. Visualize the changes you have made to the files in the folder.

# b. If you are happy with them "stage" them, that is add them to the index.

# c. Add a proper "commit" message to describe your changes. Be concise.

# d. Good! Your changes are saved. If you have the permissions to, you can 
# now push push your updated code to your online repository.
